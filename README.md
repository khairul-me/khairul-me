Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Md Khairul Islam

A passionate Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) researcher with extensive experience developing Deep Learning (DL) algorithms for Computer Vision, Object Detection, and Pose Estimation in humanoid robotics. As a first-gen undergraduate student and the first-ever Bangladeshi participant in prestigious competitions such as the International Robot Olympiad and World Robot Olympiad, I pioneered the pursuit of robotics at Hobart and William Smith Colleges, becoming the institution's first robotics student. With a strong foundation in Advanced Perception Sensor-based SLAM for robot localization, mapping, and risk-aware traversability assessment, I have demonstrated expertise in enabling autonomous robotic exploration in complex environments. My journey showcases leadership and innovation, including founding robotics clubs and leading interdisciplinary research projects. I am eager to contribute to cutting-edge robotics research in AI-based autonomous UAV systems, aiming to drive advancements that benefit terrestrial and extraterrestrial exploration.
